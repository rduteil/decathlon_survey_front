# decathlon_survey_front
Decathlon Survey project's front end (ReactJS).

This project was realised during an internship at Solutec.

The main objective was to build a web & mobile platform used by Decathlon's employees to create surveys and gather results.

This repository contains the front-end part of the web application, built in ReactJS and communicating with the back-end through a GraphQL API.
